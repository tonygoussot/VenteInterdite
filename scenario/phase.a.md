A playing session, right from the opening of the game.

# Day 0

Light. I see light. And a freaking pain in my head. My back hurts also. Cold. Why is it so freezing cold. Is this Hell ? Screams. I Hear screams Am I dead ?

All of a sudden I remember. The cryo-bed, the mission. I'm on a journey to Mullardoch Prime, a planet full of resources I shall soon be colonizing with my fellow earthlings, in an attempt to expand our civilization to another earthlike planet.

If everything went as expected, I should have hibernated for 69 years before reaching our destination, and if Nadejda (the AI running the place) woke us up, it means we should soon be orbiting our destination.

However something seems wrong. The air smells bad, the heating from the cryo-bed seems off, and I'm freezing right now.

Ok, time to get up. I'm fully naked and I turn around to jump into the tracksuit that was left there for me. 

**Acquired : Tracksuit*

A quick glimpse at the digital clock in front of confirms my worst fear It writes **3 november 2199** which I can barely wrap my head around. We should have arrived 99 years ago, in the year 2100. What the hell went wrong ? How did we survive in Cryosleep for so long ? Is everybody alive ? Is anybody running the ship ?

A little calculation comes to my mind. Fuck. I just realize I'm now turning 198 years old, since I was 30 when I left Earth. 168 years have past. This is pure madness. This is nonsense.

Let's gather our forces and get our life back.

Talking to another incoming colonist "
> - Hey there, do you know what happened to our ship ?
> - I don't know, I woke up just 10 minutes before you. I realized we hibernated passed our arrival date. I have no idea where we are right now. All I know is the exit door is locked.
> - Dammit
> - People are waking up in our quarters. I don't know If other quarters have slept through due date as well. Maybe we're the only ones left behind ?
> - I don't think so. If we'd had technical issues with our cryo-beds in our quarters only, other colonists would have activated the emergency waking procedure. I guess other quarters were locked in as well. Let's try to reach them"
>

*Suddenly, the main entrance door started to rumble. Sounds of hits resonated. Its seemed like something is trying to break into the room*

This quarters have 100 colonists capacity. I'm quite sure whatever is trying to come in isn't friendly. We should get ready for combat.

> - People, get ready for a fight there. Whatever is coming in is coming for us. Does anybody have weapons ?
> - Here, there are clubs and truncheons inside that box

> *The box contains truncheons for 3/4 of the people inside the cryo-quarters as well as bandages to help survive through the first waves of attacks*

We all started to grab clubs when the door crumbled. Fierce Dog like creatures jumped right at us. They were eager to kill. We could sense it. I saw two colonist get knocked out in front of me, they collpased on the ground, and the doglings started eating them. Whatever those hellish creatures were, they weren't the dogs we took with us in for our journey.
One of them tried to grab my feet, I hit back with all my weak strength. How lucky the cryo-sleep didn't completely malfunction and preserved some of my muscles.

Hords of Hungry "animals" attack, plenty of people are wiped out at this stage, until we finally make it out into the corridor. Monsters who kill gain experience and increase their level, making it harder to destroy them.
Once the players manage to secure their cryo-quarters, they reach the corridor where the temperature is a little bit higher. From the corridor, they can see other cryo-quarters being attacked. Eventually, they'll help the other colonists, or will be attacked by other waves of monsters , slowly gaining combat experience, or dying repetedly (which means, creating new avatars to replace those that die).

At this point people will have to explore purgatory (Or what's left of it) to find access to Paradisio and Inferno. There, they'll understand they need food, water, protection from radiations, and that their body needs proper temperature.

Food > Need to grow crops in Paradisio (Now covered in trees, water and monsters). Animals also drop food (irradiated ?), seeds (to grow crops), more rarely weapon components, and crafting blueprints,
